# Backlog

Short, prunable list of things noticed in passing that don't belong in the
current step. Add an entry instead of doing drive-by work, then revisit this
file when planning the next step or phase to decide whether each item should
fold into upcoming work or be dropped.

Keep this file small. A growing backlog is a signal to either schedule the
work or admit it isn't going to happen and delete it.

## Conventions

- One bullet per item. Include enough context (file path, symbol, or short
  description) that the next reader can act on it without spelunking.
- Optionally tag with a category in brackets, e.g. `[cleanup]`, `[perf]`,
  `[docs]`, `[idea]`.
- When an item is picked up, remove it from this file in the same commit
  that addresses it (or that schedules it into a phase).

## Items

- `[feat]` `cannet-dbc`: honour `SIG_VALTYPE_` extended value-type entries
  so IEEE float / double signals decode as floats instead of integers
  with factor/offset. Add coverage when a DBC fixture using them lands.
- `[feat]` `cannet-dbc`: surface DBC value-tables (`VAL_`) in
  `DecodedSignal` so the trace view can show enum labels.
- `[perf]` `cannet-core`: revisit `FramePayload::Classic`/`Fd` to share a
  fixed-size inline buffer instead of `Vec<u8>` once the trace store /
  benchmark in Phase 4 shows allocator pressure.
- `[docs]` `cannet-blf`: f64 BLF timestamps lose sub-µs precision at
  modern absolute times; document this in the user-facing GUI when
  surfaced timestamps look quantised.
