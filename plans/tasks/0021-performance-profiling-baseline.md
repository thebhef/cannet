# Task 21 — Performance Profiling Baseline

Profiling procedure that covers all three tiers — client (GUI),
server, and the wire between them. Metrics (frame throughput,
end-to-end latency from server ingest to GUI render, per-frame CPU
cost on each side, memory growth under sustained replay,
dropped-frame counts), instrumentation (in-process counters / timers,
sampling profiler hooks), and a reproducible workload (likely a
standard BLF replay at a known rate). Baseline numbers checked in
against the Task 8 build for each supported source (BLF replay + at
least one hardware vendor). Pulls in the perf backlog items the
baseline tends to motivate: `CanFramePayload` inline buffer and
precise time → frame-index mapping for the plot visible-range fetch.
(The two-tier per-signal sample cache and `TraceStore` disk-spill are
Task 18, not pulled in here — Task 18 owns the indefinite-length
model.)
